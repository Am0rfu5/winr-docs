# WINR Lottery for Charity Project Docs

## Introduction

This is the document repository for the WINR Lottery for Charity system, a project that aims to create a Web3 lottery system that is fair, transparent, trustless, and free of the fraud and misappropriation of funds seen in government run lottery systems. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to handle the lottery logic. The project is currently in development and is not yet deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.
