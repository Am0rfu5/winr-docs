# FAQ

## What blockchain will the Winr app be built on?

The Winr app will EVM compatible. It will be launched on a Layer 2 solution like Polygon or Optimism.

## What is the initial supply, distribution and future minting model for the CAUZ governance tokens?

If you have not read "Slicing Pie" by Mike Moyer you should. Very brief summary, the concept is that rather than trying to divvy up parts of a whole before it is made, an organization should compensate those contributing in a way commensurate with their risk at the time of contribution. As the project grows and gets nearer to completion the risk diminishes and so too should the reward for later contributors.  

As a governance token, Cauz will initially be minted and distributed to those who have contributed time, effort or financial support utilizing this concept. The same concept is to expected to continue via the smart contracts that will be deployed in the governance model. Thus the initial supply can not be determined until then.

## What are the tokenomics of the WINR utility token?

WINR Tokens are essentially 'lottery tickets' that have not yet been used to enter a lottery. They can be bought, held, traded, or used to enter a lottery. Once used to enter a lottery they are burned in exchange for 'tickets'. The supply of WINR Tokens will be determined by sales as they are minted on demand in exchange for other tokens (e.g. ETH, USDC, etc).  

These tokens will be split between the treasury vault and the prize pools. Each account holding tokens has a chance at winning the next lottery drawing.  Once that lottery is drawn the system is able to pay out to the winning account owners, Participant Users and Charities respectively, in the percentages designated for that lottery drawing based on the quantity in the pool.

## How will the exchange of cryptocurrencies for WINR Tokens be facilitated within?

The exchange of cryptocurrencies for WINR Tokens will be facilitated via a smart contract deployed as part of the application.  The smart contract will be integrated with the Winr app and will be able to accept ETH and other cryptocurrencies in exchange for WINR Tokens. The exchange rate will be fixed relative to the dollar and thus any stablecoins like USDC while the the rate relative to other cryptos like ETH will be variable based on their price relative to the dollar.

## Will the exchange rate be fixed or variable based on market conditions?

The exchange rate will be fixed relative to the dollar and thus any stablecoins like USDC while the the rate relative to other crypto like ETH will be variable based on their price relative to the dollar.

## What specific governance rights will CAUZ token holders possess?

CAUZ Token holder will have the right to create and vote on proposals.

## What types of proposals will the members of the DAO vote on? 

As with other DAO's there will be all variety of proposals including upgrades and fund allocation but there are also a few unique functions that require DAO approval. Particularly these involve the nomination, validation and approval of 'good causes' that will be eligible for distribution of lottery funds.

## Could you outline the mechanics of the lottery system (e.g., ticket pricing, frequency of draws, distribution of proceeds)?

The ticket pricing will initially be set at a fixed rate relative to a single currency, probably ETH. The frequency of draws will be set at happening approximately 3 days after the point that a minimum threshold for the total pool is met. The distribution of proceeds will be set so that a yet to be determined amount will be split between the ticket holders prize pool, the charity prize pool and the project treasury. 

## What percentage of lottery proceeds is planned to be allocated to charitable causes?

Each time a purchase is made the holder can choose which charity or charities they want to support. The percentage of the lottery proceeds are allocated to charitable causes based on these votes.

## How will rewards for validators and other contributors be calculated and distributed? 

This will be a function of the DAO and will be voted on by the DAO.

## What are the specific powers and responsibilities of administrators within the DAO?

The administrators main purpose is to facilitate the upgrade of contracts and to implement the pause function.

## How will administrators be chosen or replaced?

Administrators will initially be chosen by the founding team and then later by the DAO.s
